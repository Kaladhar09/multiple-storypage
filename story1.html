<div class="div1">
    <p align =justify>Swimming, in recreation and sports, the propulsion of the body through
      water by combined arm and leg motions and the natural flotation of the body.
       Swimming as an exercise is popular as an all-around body developer and is
       particularly useful in therapy and as exercise for physically handicapped persons.
       It is also taught for lifesaving purposes. For activities that involve swimming, s
       ee also diving, lifesaving, surfing, synchronized swimming, underwater diving, and water polo.</p></div><hr><hr>

<h2>History</h2>
<div class="div2">
<p align =justify>Archaeological and other evidence shows swimming to have been practiced as early as 2500 BCE in Egypt and
  thereafter in Assyrian, Greek, and Roman civilizations. In Greece and Rome swimming was a part of martial
  training and was, with the alphabet, also part of elementary education for males. In the Orient swimming dates
  back at least to the 1st century BCE, there being some evidence of swimming races then in Japan. By the 17th century an
  imperial edict had made the teaching of swimming compulsory in the schools. Organized swimming events were held in the 19th
   century before Japan was opened to the Western world. Among the preliterate maritime peoples of the Pacific, swimming was ev
   idently learned by children about the time they walked, or even before. Among the ancient Greeks there is note of occasional
   races, and a famous boxer swam as part of his training. The Romans built swimming pools, distinct from their baths. In the 1st
   century BCE the Roman Gaius Maecenas is said to have built the first heated swimming pool.
  The lack of swimming in Europe during the Middle Ages is explained by some authorities as having been caused by a fear that
  swimming spread infection and caused epidemics. There is some evidence of swimming at seashore resorts of Great Britain in the
  late 17th century, evidently in conjunction with water therapy. Not until the 19th century, however, did the popularity of
   swimming as both recreation and sport begin in earnest. When the first swimming organization was formed there in 1837, London
   had six indoor pools with diving boards. The first swimming championship was a 440-yard (400-metre) race, held in Australia
   in 1846 and annually thereafter. The Metropolitan Swimming Clubs of London, founded in 1869, ultimately became the Amateur
   Swimming Association, the governing body of British amateur swimming. National swimming federations were formed in several European
    countries from 1882 to 1889. In the United States swimming was first nationally organized as a sport by the Amateur Athletic Union
    (AAU) on its founding in 1888. The Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur (FINA) was founded in 1909.</p></div><hr>

    <h3>Competitive Swimming</h3>
      <div class="div3">
    <p align=justify>Internationally, competitive swimming came into prominence with its inclusion in the modern
       Olympic Games from their inception in 1896. Olympic events were originally only for men, but women’s
       events were added in 1912. Before the formation of FINA, the Games included some unusual events. In 1900,
       for instance, when the Games’ swimming events were held on the Seine River in France, a 200-metre obstacle
       race involved climbing over a pole and a line of boats and swimming under them. Such oddities disappeared after
       FINA took charge. Under FINA regulations, for both Olympic and other world competition, race lengths came increasingly
       to be measured in metres, and in 1969 world records for yard-measured races were abolished. The kinds of strokes allowed were
       reduced to freestyle (crawl), backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. All four strokes were used in individual medley races.
        Many nations have at one time or another dominated Olympic and world competition, including Hungary, Denmark, Australia, Germany,
         France, Great Britain, Canada, Japan, and the United States.</P></div><hr>

    <h4>Strokes</h4>
    <div class="div4">
    <p align= justify>The earliest strokes to be used were the sidestroke and the breaststroke. The sidestroke was originally used with both arms submerged. That practice was modified toward the end of the 19th century by bringing forward first one arm above the water, then the other, and then each in turn. The sidestroke was supplanted in competitive swimming by the crawl (see below) but is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming. The body stays on its side and the arms propel alternately. The leg motion used in sidestroke is called the scissors kick, in which the legs open slowly, under leg backward, upper leg forward, both knees slightly bent, and toes pointed. The scissoring action of the legs coming smartly together after opening creates the forward propulsion of the kick.

BreaststrokeThe stroke begins with the swimmer's feet together and drawn up toward the back. The feet kick out and down and then come back together in the middle. The hands stretch forward from the body while the head is kept underwater. The hands widen at the surface and then pull down and out. The swimmer breathes during the pull and exhales underwater.

The breaststroke is believed to be the oldest of strokes and is much used in lifesaving and recreational swimming as well as in competitive swimming. The stroke is especially effective in rough water. As early as the end of the 17th century, the stroke was described as consisting of a wide pull of the arms combined with a symmetrical action of the legs and simulating the movement of a swimming frog, hence the usual term frog kick. The stroke is performed lying face down in the water, the arms always remaining underwater. The early breaststroke featured a momentary glide at the completion of the frog kick. Later the competitive breaststroke eliminated the glide. In the old breaststroke, breath was taken in at the beginning of the arm stroke, but in the later style, breath was taken in near the end of the arm pull.

ButterflyThe stroke begins with the swimmer's arms moving in a windmill fashion from back to front. The hands then move down the chest to the hips. The legs are kept together and thrust down like a flipper in a double rhythm matching the exit and entry of the hands from the water. Breath is inhaled while the hands are underwater.

The butterfly stroke, used only in competition, differs from the breaststroke in arm action. In the butterfly the arms are brought forward above the water. The stroke was brought to the attention of U.S. officials in 1933 during a race involving Henry Myers, who used the stroke. He insisted that his stroke conformed to the rules of breaststroke as then defined. After a period of controversy, the butterfly was recognized as a distinct competitive stroke in 1953. The frog kick originally used was abandoned for a fishtail (dolphin) kick, depending only on up-and-down movement of the legs. Later swimmers used two dolphin kicks to one arm pull. Breathing is done in sprint competition by raising the head every second or third stroke.


BackstrokeThe swimmer maintains a strong and steady flutter kick, with the head held steady. The stroke begins with the arm reaching above the head and then entering the water palm out. The arm drives down and outward through the water, then turns at the elbow to sweep in toward the hip. Strokes alternate between arms, and breathing should match the rhythm of the stroke.

The backstroke began to develop early in the 20th century. In that stroke, the swimmer’s body position is supine, the body being held as flat and streamlined as possible. The arms reach alternately above the head and enter the water directly in line with the shoulders, palm outward with the little finger entering the water first. The arm is pulled back to the thigh. There is a slight body roll. The kick was originally the frog kick, but it subsequently involved up-and-down leg movements as in the crawl. The backstroke is a competition stroke, but it is also used in recreational swimming as a rest from other strokes, frequently with minimum arm motion and only enough kick to maintain forward motion.

FreestyleThe swimmer maintains a strong and steady flutter kick. The stroke begins with the swimmer's arm extending forward at about shoulder width, then coming back across the body to the hip. During recovery the arm is brought back toward the head, keeping the elbow raised above the body. Strokes alternate between arms. The swimmer exhales underwater and takes a breath when needed.

The crawl, the stroke used in competitive freestyle swimming, has become the fastest of all strokes. It is also the almost unanimous choice of stroke for covering any considerable distance. The stroke was in use in the Pacific at the end of the 19th century and was taken up by the Australian swimmer Henry Wickham about 1893. The brothers Syd and Charles Cavill of Australia popularized the stroke in Europe in 1902 and in the United States in 1903. The crawl was like the old sidestroke in its arm action, but it had a fluttering up-and-down leg action performed twice for each arm stroke. Early American imitators added an extra pair of leg actions, and later as many as six kicks were used. The kicks also varied in kind. In the crawl, the body lies prone, flat on the surface of the water, with the legs kept slightly under the water. The arms move alternately, timed so that one will start pulling just before the other has finished its pull, thus making propulsion continuous. Breathing is done by turning the head to either side during recovery of the arm from that side. Since 1896 the crawl has been used in more races than any other stroke.</p></div><hr>
